# JSONBase

It is a library that allows to use JSON files as database.

_**Note :** Do not use this library for big data. This library is suitable for use only for very small data._

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- PHP JSON Extension

## Installation

Include the JSonBase.php file and let it know in which directory to keep the JSon files.

```
composer require muhammetsafak/jsonbase
```

## Usage

```php
require_once 'src/Base.php';
```

```php
$jsonbase_dir = __DIR__ . '/data/';
$jsonbase = new \JSONBase\Base($jsonbase_dir);
```

### Table Create

For JsonBase, each table is actually a `.json` file.

```php
$jsonbase->create_table("table_name");
```

Definition of `create_table()` method:

```php
public function create_table(string $name): bool
```

### Insert

```php
$data = array("col_name" => "Value", "column" => "columnsValue");
$jsonbase->insert("table_name", $data);
```

Definition of `insert()` method

```php
public function insert(string $from, array $data): bool
```

#### Multi Insert

```php
$data = array(
    array("col_name" => "Value", "column" => "columnsValue"),
    array("col_name" => "Value2", "column" => "columnsValue2")
);
$jsonbase->multiInsert("table_name", $data);
```

Definition of `multiInsert()` method

```php
public function multiInsert(string $from, array $data): bool
```

This method may throw an error if $data is not a multi-array.

### Update

```php
$data = ["column" => "newValue", "col" => "colNewValue"];
$where = ["columnName" => "colValue"];
$jsonbase->update("table_name", $where, $data);
```

Definition of `update()` method

```php
public function update(string $from, array $where, array $data = []): bool
```

### Delete

```php
$where = ["id" => "340"];
$jsonbase->delete("table_name", $where);
```

Definition of `delete()` method

```php
public function delete(string $from, array $where): bool
```

### DROP

It tries to completely delete the table and its contents.

Definition of `drop()` method

```php
public function drop(string $from): bool
```

**Example**

```php
$jsonbase->drop("table_name");
```

### TRUNCATE

Empties all data in a table by deleting it.

```php
public function truncate(string $from): bool
```

**Example**

```php
$jsonbase->truncate("table_name");
```

### Rename

Changes the name of a table.

```php
public function rename(string $from, string $rename): bool
```

**Example**

```php
$jsonbase->rename("old_table_name", "new_table_name");
```

### Copy

Allows a table to be copied along with its data.

Caution: If there is a different table with the table name to be copied, it will overwrite (delete) it to avoid conflicts.

```php
public function copy(string $from, string $copyName): bool
```

**Example**

```php
$jsonbase->copy("table_name", "table_name_copy");
```

### Donwload

It allows you to download the JSonBase file. This method will try to initiate a download via the browser by adding a timestamp to the filename along with its contents.

```php
public function download(string $from): void
```

**Example**

```php
$jsonbase->download("table_name");
```

It stops the PHP script after it. It does nothing if the requested table does not exist.

### Tables

Returns the loaded table names as an array.

```php
public function tables(): array
```

**Example**

```php
foreach($jsonbase->tables() as $table_name){
    echo $table_name;
}
```

produces a similar output:

```
users
settings
posts
```

#### Size

Returns the total size of the table in bytes.

```php
public function size(string $from): int 
```

**Example**

```php
foreach($jsonbase->tables() as $table_name){
    echo $table_name . " : " . $jsonbase->size($table_name) . ' Byte';
}
```

produces a similar output:

```
users : 503 Byte
settings : 373 Byte
posts : 4392 Byte
```

#### rowSize

Returns the total number of rows in the table.

```php
public function rowSize(string $from): int
```

**Example**

```php
foreach($jsonbase->tables() as $table_name){
    echo $table_name . " : " . $jsonbase->rowSize($table_name) . ' rows';
}
```

produces a similar output:

```
users : 5 rows
settings : 12 rows
posts : 8 rows
```

### QUERY BUILD

You can use the `select()`, `from()` and `where()` methods to create a query in the JSonBase library.

**_`select()`_** It is used to generate a Json query. Specifies the columns in the results from the `row()` and `rows()` methods. `*` means all columns. If more than one column is desired, they must be separated by `,`.

Definition of `select()` method

```php
public function select(string $select = '*'): self
```

**_`from()`_** It is used to generate a Json query. Indicates on which Json the query to be executed with `get()` method will be executed.

Definition of `from()` method

```php
public function from(string $from): self
```

`$from` a table name.

**_`where()`_** It is used to generate a Json query. Creates a where array for the query to be executed with the `get()` method. Multiple matches can be made using this method chaining.

Definition of `where()` method

```php
public function where(string $key, string $value): self
```

`$key` a column name

`$value` value in column

Multiple where can be added using the `where()` method multiple times in a row or chaining.

The query constructed with the `from()` and `where()` methods should be executed with the `get()` method.

**_`get()`_** Execute the query created with the `select()`, `from()` and `where()` methods and get the results if any. You can access the results obtained with this method with the `row()`, `rows()` methods.

Definition of `get()` method

```php
public function get(): self
```

#### Results

You can access the results obtained by executing the `get()` method with the `row()`, `rows()` methods.

**_`row()`_** Returns the first result obtained as an associative array.

Definition of `row()` method

```php
public function row(): array|false
```

**_`rows()`_** Returns the resulting results as an associative array.

Definition of `rows()` method

```php
public function rows(): array|false
```

#### Num_Rows

**_`num_rows()`_** Returns the number of rows affected.

Definition of `num_rows()` method

```php
public function num_rows(): int
```

# Examples

Suppose we have a `students.json` file like the one below.

```json
[
    {"id":"885","name":"Muhammet","sex":"male","age":"18"},
    {"id":"956","name":"John","sex":"male","age":"18"},
    {"id":"957","name":"Jennifer","sex":"famale","age":"17"},
    {"id":"958","name":"Elizabeth","sex":"famale","age":"19"}
]
```

**Example 1 :**

```php
$jsonbase->select('name')->from('students')->where('id', '885')->get();
$size = $jsonbase->num_rows();
if($size > 0){
    $row = $jsonbase->row();
    echo $row['name'];
}else{
    echo 'Result not found!';
}
```

Output:

```
Muhammet
```

**Example 2 :**

```php
$jsonbase->select('id, name')->from('students')->where('sex', 'male')->get();
$size = $jsonbase->num_rows();
if($size > 0){
    foreach($jsonbase->rows() as $row){
        echo $row['id'] . " - " . $row['name'] . "\n";
    }
}else{
    echo 'Result not found!';
}
```

Output:

```
885 - Muhammet
956 - John
```

**Example 3 :**

```php
$jsonbase->select('id, name')->from('students')->where('sex', 'famale')->where('age', '17')->get();
$size = $jsonbase->num_rows();
if($size > 0){
    foreach($jsonbase->rows() as $row){
        echo $row['id'] . " - " . $row['name'] . "\n";
    }
}else{
    echo 'Result not found!';
}
```

Output:

```
957 - Jennifer
```
